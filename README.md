# E-commerce customer journey analytics â€” repo overview

This repository contains code and resources for the final year project on E-commerce customer journey analytics. Below is a short, plain-language explanation of what each top-level file or folder does so your team members can quickly understand the project structure.

## What each file/folder does (easy language)

- `.git/`
	- Hidden folder used by Git to track changes. You normally don't need to open this.

- `backend/`
	- Contains the server-side code (the application that processes data, runs analytics, or serves APIs). Think of this as the "brains" of the project. Look inside this folder for source files and any README with start instructions.

- `db/`
	- Database-related items such as SQL scripts, seed data, or migration files. This is where data schemas or sample data may live.

- `demo/`
	- Simple demo assets to show features or visualizations. For example, `demo/demo.html` is a quick front-end file you can open in your browser to see a demonstration.

- `docker-compose.yml`
	- A configuration file that describes how to start multiple parts of the project (like the backend and database) using Docker containers. If you have Docker installed, this can often start everything with one command.

- `README.md`
	- This file. Use it to document the repo so other team members understand what everything is and how to run the project.

## Quick ways to try things (simple)

- View the demo in a browser:

```powershell
# From your file explorer or terminal, open this file:
start demo\demo.html
```

- If you want to run the whole project with Docker (if Docker is installed):

```powershell
# Run this in the repository root to start services defined in docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up --build
```

Notes:
- If you open `backend/` or `db/`, check for more README or `requirements.txt` / `package.json` files that explain how to start the server locally.
- If you want, tell me which folder you want documented in more detail (for example, list of files inside `backend/` and what each source file does) and I will expand this README with those descriptions.

## Who to ask

If anything here is unclear, ask the team member who worked on that folder (or tell me which folder you want me to inspect and I'll add more detail).
